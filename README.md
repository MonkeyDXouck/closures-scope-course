# Closures and Scope course in JavaScript

### Closure

A **closure** is a function that remembers the lexical environment in which it was created. 
This means that the function can access the variables of its external environment even 
after that environment has ceased to exist.

### Scope

Determines the accessibility of variables and functions in different parts of the code.
JavaScript has two main types of scope: global and local.

**Global Scope:** Variables defined in the global scope are accessible from anywhere in the code.

**Scope Local:** Variables defined within a function are only accessible from within that function.

### Hoisting

JavaScript behaviour in which variable and function declarations are moved to the beginning of 
their scope before code execution. Only declarations are moved up, not initialisations.
